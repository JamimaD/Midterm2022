Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

1. why do we need data structure?
Data structure provides a way of organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently.
They are mainly of two types:
Linear Data structure: Here the Data elements are organised in a sequence of some manner.
Non-linear Data structure: Here the data is ordered in any arbitrary order and not in a sequence
Some common data structures are
Linked list
Arrays
Stacks
Queues
Binary trees
Hash tables


2. What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Insertion: Add a new data item in the given collection of data items.
Deletion: Delete an existing data item from the given collection of data items.
Traversal: Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
Searching: Find out the location of the data item if it exists in the given collection of data items.
Sorting: Arranging the data items in some order i.e. in ascending or descending order in case of numerical data and in
dictionary order in case of alphanumeric data.


3. List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Data structures are used in any program or software.
They are used in the areas of
Compiler Design
Operating System
DBMS
Graphics
Simulation
Numerical Analysis
Artificial Intelligence


4. what is an Array?
Array is a variable that can hold multiple value in the same time.


5. what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. We cannot change length
of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed. We cannot store primitives in ArrayList, it can only store
objects. But array can contain both primitives and objects in Java.

6. what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.


7. How is an ArrayList different from Linked List?
ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements. LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its
elements. ArrayList is slow as array manipulation is slower. LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit
shifting required.


8. what is queue?
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is
First In First Out (FIFO)/ Last In Last Out(LILO).


9. what is stack?
It is a collection that applies the concept of First In Last Out(FILO)/ Last In First Out(LIFO).


10. what is FIFO and LIFO?
First In First Out (FIFO) and Last In First Out(LIFO).


11. what is the order of complexity?
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²).


12. what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Sequential search is the best that we can do when trying to find a value in an unsorted array.


13. what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst-case performance is when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all. This would require N
comparisons, hence, the worse case is O(N).


14. what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are connected
by edges. A tree has the following properties: The tree has one node called root. The tree originates from this, and
hence it does not have any parent.


15. what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as
vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.


16. what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Though both Hashtable and HashMap are data-structure based upon hashing and implementation of Map interface, the main
difference between them is that HashMap is not thread-safe but Hashtable is thread-safe. This means you cannot use
HashMap in a multi-threaded Java application without external synchronization. Another difference is HashMap allows
one null key and null values but Hashtable doesn't allow null key or values. Also, the thread-safety of the hash table
is achieved using internal synchronization, which makes it slower than HashMap.


17. What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs whenever we are trying to access any item of an array at an index which is
not present in the array. In other words, the index may be negative or exceed the size of an array.


18. What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
There are different methods to copy an array.
You can use a for loop and copy elements of one to another one by one.
Use the clone method to clone an array.
Use arraycopy() method of System class.
Use copyOf() or copyOfRange() methods of Arrays class.


19. What is difference between an array and a linked list?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of the
same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers. Array elements can be accessed randomly using
the array index. Random accessing is not possible in linked lists.


20. What is DFS and BFS?
BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search. 2. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data
structure for finding the shortest path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.


21. What is Recursion?
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems
down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

22. What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear data structures- Array list, Linked list, Queue, Stack.
Non linear data structures- Graphs, Trees.

23. What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big-O is a standard mathematical notation that shows how efficient an algorithm is in the worst-case scenario relative
to its input size.


24. Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

25. Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
